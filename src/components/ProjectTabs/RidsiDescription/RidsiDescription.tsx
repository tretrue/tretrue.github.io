            RIDSI stands for The Regional Intelligent Transportation System Data
            Sharing Initiative. RIDSI is the central source and delivery point
            for historical and active event/transportation information. RIDSI
            leverages big data analytics to host a data warehouse that collects
            raw information from critical transportation partners, normalizes
            the information into a consistent format, and supports archive and
            delivery of the information back to the contributing partners and
            other approved agencies. From this central source, an agency, firm,
            or regional partner can review, download, or develop their own
            analysis of traffic from around the state. The projectâ€™s focus is to
            allow regional transportation data information be more widely
            available and used as a resource to support planning, decision
            making, operations management, and incident response.

            application utilizes Amazon FireBase and FireStore Real Time
            Database for manipulating data.
